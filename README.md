Temple of ROM II
==========

Starting from a disassembly of a Temple of ROM cart by William Astle, I've managed to build the game successfully.
I'm hoping to expand the game by adding new features:

* More levels
* More monsters
* Doors and keys?

I'm hoping to have something available for sale eventually.

### Changes

Created project from Temple of ROM disassembly.

Clean up direct page.

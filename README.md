Temple of ROM II
==========

Starting from a disassembly of a Temple of ROM cart by William Astle, I've managed to build the game successfully.
I'm hoping to expand the game by adding new features:

* Expand level?
* More levels?
* More monsters?
* Different monsters?
* Doors and keys?
* Level editor?

I'm hoping to maybe have something available for sale eventually.

### Changes

Created project from Temple of ROM disassembly.

Cleaned up direct page.

Split into separate source files.

Deciphered maze, monster, portal and treasure data formats.

Added one more spider as a test.

Added utility to generate maze data from a graphic
